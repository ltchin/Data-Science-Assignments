### Files for "Getting and Cleaning Data"
* CodeBook.md - code book for all of the variables, data, and transformations performed
* run_analysis.R - cleans and tidies data for Samsung data. 
* tidy_table.csv - the actual tidy data set

This program takes the data from the UC Irvine "Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones Data Set" and takes the average of the mean and standard deviation for all of the variables measured.
Run "run_analysis.R" to generate a tidy version of that data.
Read why the tidy data is actually tidy in CodeBook.md

### Files for "R Programming"
* cachematrix.R - provides cached version of inverting a matrix
